# 0x00. ES6 Basics

## What is ES6?

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the JavaScript language. It brings significant improvements and new features to make JavaScript more powerful, expressive, and easier to work with.

## New Features introduced in ES6

ES6 introduced several new features and enhancements, including:

1. **Constants (`const`) and Variables (`let`):** ES6 introduced `const` and `let` for declaring variables. `const` creates a constant whose value cannot be changed once it's assigned, while `let` declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.

2. **Block-scoped variables:** Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.

3. **Arrow Functions:** Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They also lexically bind the `this` value, which can be advantageous in certain situations.

4. **Default Parameters in Functions:** ES6 allows function parameters to have default values. This means you can specify default values for parameters in case they are not provided by the caller.

5. **Rest and Spread Operators:** The rest (`...`) and spread (`...`) operators were introduced to work with variable-length argument lists. The rest operator gathers the remaining parameters into an array, while the spread operator spreads elements of an iterable (like arrays) into individual elements.

6. **String Templating:** ES6 introduced template literals, allowing for easier string interpolation and multiline strings. Template literals are enclosed by backticks (\`\`) and can contain placeholders `${}` for embedding expressions.

7. **Object Creation and Properties:** ES6 introduced shorthand property syntax for object literals, computed property names, and methods in object declarations, making object creation and manipulation more concise and expressive.

8. **Iterators and for-of Loops:** ES6 introduced the concept of iterators and the `for-of` loop for iterating over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc. This provides a simpler and more intuitive way to iterate over collections.

These are just some of the key features introduced in ES6. There are many more enhancements and additions to the language.
