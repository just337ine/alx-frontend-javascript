## Basic Types in TypeScript

TypeScript offers several basic types such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `object`, among others. These types help in defining the data structures and variables in your codebase.

For detailed information on basic types, refer to the official TypeScript documentation: [TypeScript Basic Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)

---

## Interfaces, Classes, and Functions

Interfaces, classes, and functions form the core of TypeScript's type system. They enable developers to define custom data structures, encapsulate logic, and declare function signatures with specific input and output types.

For comprehensive guidance on using interfaces, classes, and functions, consult the TypeScript documentation: [TypeScript Handbook - Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html), [Classes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html), [Functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html)

## Working with the DOM in TypeScript

TypeScript facilitates working with the Document Object Model (DOM) by providing type definitions for DOM elements and events. This enables developers to write type-safe code when interacting with HTML elements and handling user interactions.

Explore TypeScript's DOM manipulation capabilities in the documentation: [TypeScript and the DOM](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/dom-manipulation.html)

---

## Generic Types

Generic types in TypeScript allow for the creation of reusable components that can work with a variety of data types. They provide flexibility and type safety when dealing with collections, functions, and classes.

For a deeper understanding of generic types, refer to the TypeScript handbook: [TypeScript Handbook - Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html)

---

## Namespaces

Namespaces in TypeScript provide a way to organize code by grouping logically related entities into a single container. They help prevent naming collisions and improve code organization and readability.

Learn more about namespaces in TypeScript from the official documentation: [TypeScript Namespaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html)

---

## Merging Declarations

TypeScript allows declarations from multiple sources to be merged into a single definition. This feature is particularly useful when working with libraries or frameworks that span multiple files.

Read about declaration merging in the TypeScript documentation: [TypeScript Handbook - Declaration Merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html)

---

## Using Ambient Namespace to Import External Libraries

Ambient namespaces in TypeScript provide a way to import external JavaScript libraries and provide type information for them. This allows for seamless integration of existing JavaScript codebases into TypeScript projects.

Explore ambient namespaces in TypeScript: [TypeScript Handbook - Ambient Declarations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/by-example.html)

## Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript

Nominal typing in TypeScript allows developers to create types that are distinguished based on their names, rather than their structure. This can be useful for enforcing stricter type checks and improving code clarity.
